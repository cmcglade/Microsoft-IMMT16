            <p> Hey guys, I'm Russel.
                <br> <span class="highlight">I'm a 23 year old philanthropist</span> working as the Executive Sanitation Engineer. No I'm kidding, why would I have a page about me if I was an executive sanitation engineer. I'm in charge of ensuring the espresso machine is working and in charge of scheduling random meetings. Got you didn't I? I was joking again. I'll stop joking now. I have no sense of humor, sorry.
                <p>I'm just a guy working in a cubicle in the corner of the office. I don't even know what I'm doing. I'm kidding, I'm in an office. It's beside Bill Gates. Yeah that's right. I'm in an office beside Bill Gates. I'm in charge of the financial aspect of the company. Cool right? No it's boring. I hate looking at numbers. I wish I could just retire. But don't worry, Microsoft will be there for you if you screw up. I'm done. Peace.</p> 
                <p>I was kidding about being a philanthropist.</p>
